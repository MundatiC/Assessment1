let sum = 5+ 5+"5";

console.log(sum);
console.log(`The result will be ${sum} since Javascript evaluates expressions from let to right and thus string 5 will be concatenated to the sum of the first expresion. This is because the first '+' is  the addition operator since its used with numbers and the second '+'  concatenated the strings because when '+' is used with strings it performs concatenation.`);
